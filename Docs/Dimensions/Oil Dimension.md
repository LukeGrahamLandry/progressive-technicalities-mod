Very very extreme mountains. The surface is made of obsidian, oceans of oil and stone is Ignous Rock (darker and low explosion resistance). The only place to mine titanium ore (must use a carbide pickaxe). Eternal night (with no sky light) so bring some night vision potions.

Many mobs spawn naturally in large groups
- Zombies, Skeletions, Spiders, Creepers
- Silverfish, Cave Spiders
- Slimes, Witches, Phantoms
- Blazes, Ghasts, Wither Skeletons
