A portal can be created by right clicking a patch of five grass in a plus shape with a *fey portal key*. Fall on the center block to change dimensions. Portals in the feywild automaticly close after five minutes so bring an extra portal key or get out quick.

Quite flat grassy landscape. Lakes of liquid silver (causes damage if you don't have fire resistance). Lot's of vegitaion: giant mushrooms, flowers, melons. Eternal day. Underground is made of *solid fairy dust* which is slow to break but vulnerable to explosions. Fey steel ore can be found and made into [[Feysteel Armour]].
