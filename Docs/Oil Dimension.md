Very very extreme mountains. The surface is made of obsidian, oceans of oil (with chromium ore underneath) and stone is Ignous Rock (darker and low explosion resistance). The only place to mine titanium ore (must use a carbide pickaxe). All ways night (with no sky light) so bring some [[Night Vision Goggles]].

Many mobs spawn naturally in large groups
- Zombies, Skeletions, Spiders, Creepers
- Silverfish, Cave Spiders
- Slimes, Witches, Phantoms
- Blazes, Ghasts, Wither Skeletons
- Evokers, Vexes
- Withers (yes really)

BTW, swimming in oil gives blindness and slowness V
frost walker works on oil (oil ice is extra slippery)
