Alloys are made by crafting two dusts (made in [[Pulverizer]]) together and then using an [[Induction Smelter]] to make ingots

Carbide + Titanium = Steel
Gold + Silver = Electrum
Electrum + Sky Gem (not dust) = Varidium
Steel + Varidium = Diastima
Steel + Unobtanium Shard = Unobtanium
Steel + Bedrockium Shard = Bedrockium
