As you spend time in a world the monsters get more powerful. This scaling is independant of difficulty. Each hour monsters scale up. Equipment given in this way is never dropped

### How they improve

Hours 1-5, zombie varients and skeletons get improving armor 
On hour 6 they get helmets (so they don't burn)
Then over 7-9 they get protection IV, thorns III and feather falling / depth strider

Hours 1-5 zombie varients (and wither skeletons) get improving swords
Hours 6-10 give increasing levels of sharpness
Hour 11 gives them fire aspect II
Then for the next 10 hours they get increasing levels of strength (max V)

Hours 1-5 skeletons get increasing levels of power
On hour 6 they get flame II
Hours 7 / 8 give punch I / II
Hour 10 they get poision arrows

Spiders, cave spiders, slimes and magma cubes get increasing levels strength from hours 1-10 but so do friendly things like wolves and iron golems

Monsters mentioned above get the following potion effects. Blazes and ghasts get the same but delayed 5 hours
Hours 10-15 give speed 
Hour 20 gives regen
Hours 20-30 give absourbtion (1 extra heart each)
Hour 25 gives fire resistance

After hour 25, creepers get one minute of invisability
and snow golems get 1 hour of fire resistance (so they don't melt in hot biomes)
After 40 hours, creepers get a minute of speed 3

Buffed monsters have a chance to drop special items when they are killed by players. The drop pool starts empty and each entry has a 20% chance to be selected
On hour 5 diamond ore is added
On hour 10 xp charge is added (worth 10 levels)
On hour 20 titanium ingot is added
On hour 30 unobtanium shard is added 
On hour 35 greater xp charge is added (worth 30 levels)

Note: all potion effects end after 30 minutes but its likely no monster will last that long
