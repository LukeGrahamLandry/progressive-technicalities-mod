Can be used to create any enchanted book (not from other mods tho). Always uses a book in the first slot and the item in the second slot determines which enchantment you get. Enchantments are always at level one but can be combined in an anvil to get higher levels. Costs some experience levels, most cost 10, treasure enchants cost 39.
